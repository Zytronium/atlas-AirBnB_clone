### How to start the console
Because of certain restrictions, this console was designed for Python 3.8,*
though it works on the latest Python 3.12 and most likely with 3.13 (whose
release date is Oct 1st 2024). It is also recommended to use a terminal that
supports the following text effects: colors, bold, concealed, reversed, and
blinking.

To start the command interpreter, the best way to run it is by opening it in
a terminal. Here are the most likely commands that are needed to run in the
terminal, based on which operating system you are on (assuming the current
directory is `atlas-AirBnB_clone`):

<details>
<summary>Linux (or WSL)</summary>

With python installed in /bin/python3:
```bash 
./console.py
```
With python installed somewhere else:
```bash
python3 ./console.py
```
or
```bash
python ./console.py
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>MacOS</summary>

*This is a placeholder command. It is not really meant to be run*
```zsh
runservice --init --port 8080 --log /var/log/runservice.log
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

```shell
.\console.py
```
or
```shell
python3 .\console.py
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Minecraft (Command Block)</summary>

```commandblock
/execute as @p run file[name=console.py]
```
Okay, maybe that doesn't work in Minecraft, but it could be recreated in
Minecraft with some time and dedication.
</details>

*: Support for Python 3.8 will drop when 3.13 comes out on October 1st. It is
therefore recommended to use 3.9 or later instead.
